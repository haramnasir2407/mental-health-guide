title: Seek Professional Support
---

If the aforementioned strategies fail to relive stress and enhance your emotional resilience, it might be time for you to delve deeper into what might be causing the struggle and explore alternative solutions. Consider consulting a mental health professional such as a therapist to identify unresolved challenges that might be affecting your resilience and explore underlying stressors. A therapist can work with you to identify workplace stressors, learn adaptive coping mechanisms and devise a customised intervention plan for improving overall mental wellbeing.

If you have exhausted all the options available to you and still find that your work is causing mental distress, it may be a sign that the job or the work environment might not be a good fit for you. True resilience is not just about improving your ability to endure stress, but it is also about knowing when to correct course and walk away to preserve your mental well-being. At times a burnout does not go away with minor adjustments and you may need to step away from the source of the stress to find relief. At times you may run into the realisation that your job is misaligned with your values or your passion. Whatever the case maybe, sometimes resilience might mean acknowledging that a work place is no longer serving you and a change is required!
